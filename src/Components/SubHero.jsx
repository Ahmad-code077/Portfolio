          Hi, I’m Ahmad. I’m a self-taught full stack developer who enjoys
          turning ideas into real applications. I started out just curious about
          how websites work, and that curiosity grew into a love for building
          complete web experiencesfrom what you see on the screen to the logic
          running behind it. For me, it’s about creating things that people
          actually enjoy using.
